The goal of this project is to investigate how differences in RNA Sequences affect the different folding of RNA
Current research suggests that stable secondary stuctures in RNA decreases the rate of Translation.
This program will determine which Sequences are most likely to have decreased translation of mRNA
At the very worst this program will act as a way to generate phylogenetic trees and run RNAfold on large number of sequences
This also generates seperate fasta files for each of the original fasta files
This is intended to work for any fasta file containing DNA sequences. Larger Sequences = larger Run time
The Sample data provided compares Insulin protein sequence

Part 1) - a phytlogenetic tree will be used to illustrate the differences between the sequences

Part 2) - RNA fold will be used to demonstrate how the different mutations affect folding


Becasue the sequences are of different lengths
based on the data from this simulation it seems that more closely related sequences demonstrate the most similar percent folding
Based on this evidence it seems human insulin will have the highest rate of translation of the sequences provided
